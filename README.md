<b>About the company<b>
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Our company has been tasked to: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. To do this our comapny is
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.


Goal of the project is to answer this question:
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently?

1. A clear statement of the business task
